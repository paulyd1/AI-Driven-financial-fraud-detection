# Financial Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect financial fraud based on transactional data.  
The goal is to explore data preprocessing techniques, handle class imbalance, and evaluate predictive models for fraud detection.

The notebook walks through:
- Data loading and exploration  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature selection and scaling  
- Model training  
- Model evaluation and results

## 📊 Results Summary

The model demonstrates the ability to distinguish fraudulent from non-fraudulent transactions.  
Performance is evaluated using metrics such as:

- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score  
- Confusion Matrix  

Final model highlights:  

The final model achieved strong recall on fraudulent transactions, showing good ability to identify high-risk cases despite class imbalance.
